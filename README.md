About
-----

When creating Browser versions of libraries and applications with the
help of the excellent [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) toolchain
one often has to replace certain strings during the transformation.
A usual use-case is the replacement of placeholders with the current
version number, etc. This Browserify transform allows you
to apply one or more Regular Expression based string replacements.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install -g browserify
$ npm install -g browserify-replace
```

Usage
-----

#### Shell

```shell
$ browserify -t [ browserify-replace \
                  --replace '{ "from": "\\$foo", "to": 42 }' \
                  --replace '{ "from": "\\$bar", "to": "quux" }' ] \
             -o sample.browser.js sample.js
```

#### Grunt

```js
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-browserify");
    grunt.initConfig({
        browserify: {
            "sample": {
                files: {
                    "sample.browser.js": [ "sample.js" ]
                },
                options: {
                    transform: [
                        [   "browserify-replace", {
                                replace: [
                                    { from: /\$foo/, to: 42 },
                                    { from: /\$bar/, to: "quux" }
                                ]
                            }
                        ]
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        [...]
    });
    [...]
};
